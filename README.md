# hashmap

This is my tenth project within the Full Stack JavaScript course from The Odin Project, continuing my coursework within the JavaScript chapter of the course. This project responds to the prompt wherein students are challenged to create a HashMap class or factory function with methods for hashing keys, assigning values, retrieving and removing keys/values, and more. This project continues to develop knowledge in data structures, algorithms, time/space complexity, and (now) hash tables and linked lists, implementing this knowledge as an opportunity to practice considering the most efficient method to achieve functionality and effectively manipulate data/structures within a given context. Unlike with the Linked List project, I chose not to implement modules in this project, but I know that this project itself can be a module implemented into later projects requiring the management of data within a hash table.
